            <h1> Ideas Connected </h1>
            <p> People assume creativity is a crazy outburst of original ideas. Actually, it is <strong> mixing and matching ideas you already know in a different context.</strong> When your brain <strong> creates a link between what you already know and a new context</strong>, that is an original insight.</p>
            <p> Now imagine if you are able to <strong>map out links </strong>for all of your information, and <strong>see the links </strong>that your friends, family and strangers create. How many more ideas and insights you would have? </p>
            <p> That's what Project Meta is about. You create links between information, and so will everyone around you. In doing so, you have a network of ideas from all contexts, domains and backgrounds. This helps you <strong> know more, learn more and create more.</strong></p>
            <p> Are you in? </p>
